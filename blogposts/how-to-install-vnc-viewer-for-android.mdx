#### Let's install compatible VNC Viewer App

If you want to install `VNC Viewer` App on an Android phone, you have two options. First, you can install it from the Play Store by searching for Termux, but sometimes not available; your phone may show a compatibility error. So it's not the ideal solution. Second, you can install it from a browser or from websites like uptodown, etc. I recommend the second method, which is more popular for getting the **VNC Viewer App**. It is not much dangerous; I also use it for viewing Termux GUI on my phone. Also, it works smoothly with minimal issues.

#### Step 1 » First Download APK file of VNC Viewer App

[Download VNC Viewer App from Play Store &#129095;](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realvnc.viewer.android&pcampaignid=web_share)

Download the VNC Viewer APK from the official uptodown.com. Go there and choose the version you want, then click on Download APK.

#### Step 2 » Run Termux APK file to install VNC Viewer App

Once you've downloaded the APK file, you will find it in the browser's Downloads section (click on the three dots in the top-right corner and go to the Downloads section) or in your File Manager app. You need to run this file to install the actual Termux app. During this process, you'll need to allow your browser or file manager to install apps from unknown sources. Simply go to your browser/File Manager settings `(exp: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)`, and enable the option to install apps from unknown sources, then install it.
